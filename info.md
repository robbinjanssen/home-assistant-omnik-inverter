## Omnik Inverter Sensor Component for Home Assistant.

The Omnik solar sensor component will retrieve data from an Omnik solar inverter.
The values will be presented by two devices in Home Assistant. One is the inverter containing the actual solar power, and one is the device containing information about the wifi signal.

Find the full documentation [here](https://github.com/robbinjanssen/home-assistant-omnik-inverter).
## Configuration

To configure the component, add it using the integrations page. This will provide you with a configuration screen where you can first select the data source. After selecting the data source, enter a name and IP address (and in case of HTML a username/password) and you're good to go!

_Optionally you can update the scan interval in the integration settings._
